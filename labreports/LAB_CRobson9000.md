## 1. Overview
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam Smith, a student at Messiah University, was complaining about how his schedule this semester didn't allow time for him to get lunch.  In an annoyed voice he said, “I would like to order a meal from an on-campus provider, and have it delivered to my classroom”.  I've been tasked with critically analyzing this problem to create a system in which Sam can order his lunch from the Union and have it delievered to his classroom so he won't be late and so that he can eat lunch.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I will need to work with the Union and Falcon to solve this problem because they already have ordering systems and are in the business of selling food to Messiah students.  With access to their ordering apps, I'll be able to modify them to include a delivery feature.  I'll need to consult with them about how this idea will effect their busineses, some of these effects being hiring more staff, accounting for more orders which affects supply managament, and possible changes in how they implement the ordering system.  I will also need to work with Sam and other students like Sam to determine the modified app's function.

The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.

## Appendix: GitHub Notes

### A.1 Forked Repository
In this section, provide a diagram that demonstrates the relationship between the [source repository](https://github.com/trevordbunch/cis411_lab0_req) and your forked repository in *Step 1.*  

### A.2 Git Logs
In this section, provide the logs from *Step 2.7* and *Step 6.4*.

Hint: for system output, use markdown's fenced code block for formatting.

### Github Diagram
<em>Note: I combined both the diagrams together because I thought that it better illustrated the relationships you were asking for in a big-picture sense. </em>
